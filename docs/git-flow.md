# Git Flow

Git flow is a organize model created by Vincent Driessen and exposed in [this link](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). In few words, you need to have two branchs which has infinite life, `master` and `develop` and others support branches that could be merged on `develop` then, finally, merged on `master` for enter at live.
